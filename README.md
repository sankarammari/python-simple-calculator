A Simple Calculator using Python Tkinter is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator uses the Tkinter library to create buttons for digits and operations, and a display to show input and results.
